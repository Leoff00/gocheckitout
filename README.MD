# Go checkitout 

---

Go checkitout is my personal project to make requests and bring site/webpage infos like:

```Go
res.StatusCode //output 200
res.Header // Header contents like content-type, accept, etc...
```

---

**To run this this project type in the terminal:**

```sh
./bin/main.exe
```
**or**

```sh
go run main.go
```

This is a side project to improve my skills in go lang. Learn Golang here in the [Golang Docs](https://go.dev/doc/).
